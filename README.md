# Fill-4x3-numbre-grid
A game made in python using tkinter (ik, horrible). The objective is to fill all grids with a number from 1-8, but it cant be consecutive.

# How it works?

The code starts at a grid, then checks for all directions (vertical, horizontal and diaognal) if there is a consecutive number, e.g: if the actual grid is 7 and the up-left grid is 6, then it fails and is a game over.

# How do i solve it?

There is only one way to solve it, and is:

<details>
  <summary>Solution:</summary>
  
first row: 3, 5  
second row: 7, 1, 8, 2  
third row: 4, 6  

</details>

Note: order can be reversed.
